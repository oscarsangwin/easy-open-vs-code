# easy-open-vs-code
Extremely simple shell script to open Visual Studio Code from the terminal, designed for macOS x

--- Usage ---
* vs                          (opens vs code from working directory)
* vs __direcory_name_here__   (opens vs code from the specified directory)

Saves a lot of time when working in the terminal, then needing to switch to vs code in the same directory!
